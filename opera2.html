    <king>King:</king> <song><pre>To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
    use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
    perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
    all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
    sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
    Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
    impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
    Articles of Association?</pre></song>

    <songf>Sir, they are here.</songf>
  
    <direction>(Enter Lord Dramaleigh, Captain Corcoran, Sir Bailey Barre, Mr.
    Blushington, and Mr. Goldbury from different entrances.)</direction>
  
    <king>King:</king> <song><pre>Oh!  (Addressing them)  Gentlemen, our daughter holds
    her first Drawing-Room in half an hour, and we shall have time to
    make our half-yearly report in the interval.  I am neces-sarily
    unfamiliar with the forms of an English Cabinet
    Councilâ€”perhaps the Lord Chamberlain will kindly put us in
    the way of doing the thing properly, and with due regard to the
    solemnity of the occasion.</pre></song>
